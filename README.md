## Abstract

Discussions on the “4th Industrial Revolution (4IR)” have been actively conducted in Korea since 2016. Accordingly, resolving social conflicts caused by technological advancement to promote innovation has emerged as a pressing agenda. Nevertheless, the public’s reaction to technology-related conflicts is understudied although the importance of the role and opinions of the public should be considered in the process of innovation. Therefore, the current study aims to analyze the public interests in technology-related conflicts by measuring the degree of conflict represented among them. To this end, we applied Structural Topic Modeling on news articles on 4IR conflicts from 2016 to 2020. As a result, we found 13 comprehensive topics on the 4IR conflict discussed by the media. The degree to which the public accepted the discourses was not the same across topics. When the public's level of conflict response was high, the topic prevalence of "elections," "parliamentary activities," "mobility conflicts," and "labor-management conflicts" significantly increased, while those of "balanced development," "small and medium enterprises," "global corporations," and "technology and humans" significantly decreased. The former group of topics was related to political and economical conflicts. The result indicates that the public highlights political and economical topics while neglecting industrial and technological topics when they debate on 4IR conflict issues. This is because they primarily respond to political or political economic issues when they consume news media.
